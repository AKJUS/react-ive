## Authentication
- None of the endpoints currently require authentication. It is highly recommended to add JWT token validation (e.g., via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) for both `/profile/updateProfile/:userId` and `/profile/getUser/:userId` to restrict access to authorized users, as these endpoints handle sensitive user data.

## Error Handling
- **404 Not Found**: User not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server issues.

## Notes
- The `/profile/updateProfile/:userId` endpoint supports partial updates, only updating fields provided in the request body.
- The `subjects` field in the request is an array of subject names, which are upserted into the `Subjects` collection, and their IDs are stored in the userâ€™s `subjects` field.
- The `/profile/getUser/:userId` endpoint populates the `subjects` field with full subject details (e.g., `_id`, `name`) from the `Subjects` collection.
- The `password` field, if updated, is stored as provided (consider adding hashing with `bcrypt`, as seen in the `/auth` endpoints, for security).
- No rate-limiting middleware is specified for these endpoints, unlike the `/post` or `/subjects` routes.
- Consider adding validation for fields like `email` (e.g., using `validator.isEmail`) or `userType` (e.g., restricting to "student" or "guardian") to ensure data integrity.
